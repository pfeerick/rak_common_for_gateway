# rak_common_for_gateway

##	Introduction 

The aim of this project is to help users to use the RAK Raspberry Pi Developer Gateway more easily. The User Guide can be get from our Web(https://docs.rakwireless.com/Introduction/).

[BEGIN EDIT INSTRUCTION FOR PINE64 GATEWAY (ONLY TESTED FOR TTN SO FAR]:

*** EDITED for work with Pine64 Gateway - work in progress more information/instruction soon *** -RTP

### Pine64 Gateway Setup

*NOTE: my goal was basically at this point to get the concentrator started/GPS working. If you notice changes needed
please do post an issue/submit or fork something! Thanks! :)

General Steps:

*** First make sure you have LoRa antenna + GPS antenna (preferably outside or antenna by the window- without GPS it will not show up on TTN); ***Very Important*** to
have antennas before attempting to setup or you could damage your device ***

1.) Download your distribution of choice
(you can try one of the SOPINE/LTS capable distros; There was a boot problem on the Armbian image as of this writing I have patched an Armbian image you can find here:
https://mega.nz/file/Wd5CGRhB#spBqSQrhLm_gIPtRexV9OOC8T3YoVk9VuHopFs4Ho9o
)

2.) After installing an LTS/SOPINE compatible image to sdcard/emmc, boot up and clone this fork by issuing:
clone https://github.com/RightToPrivacy/rak_common_for_gateway.git

3.) Now issue: sudo armbian-config -> System and enable UART/SPI/I2C (Concentrator/GPS/Temp sensor)

4.) Make sure /boot/armbianEnv.txt has this line in it: param_spidev_spi_bus=0

5.) Reboot for changes to take effect.  

6.) cd into your cloned rak_common_for_gateway directory (cloned from this fork from step #2)

7.) Follow rak_common_for_gateway instructions

8.) After installing everything (using clone edit) open the command: sudo gateway-config

9.) inside gateway-config go to packet forwarder config editing

10.) make sure the SPI device says /dev/spidev0.0 and not something else 

11.) make sure the GPS device is /dev/ttyS2 

12.) Save the Packet Forwarder config and change the LoRa channel config to TTN (The Things Network)

13.) Select your country's LoRa location/frequency

14.) Restart Packet Forwarder and quit

15.) Check the status by viewing journalctl or systemctl status ttn-gateway; if not active, check journalctl to see what failed and its reasoning

16.) You may need to enter gateway-config again and re-enter the devices in case a 3rd party package changes them (something I noticed and have not edited atm)

17.) Once GPS registers reliable signal (usually a few min after starting) you should see your Gateway on TTN map and tcpdump|grep 1700 should show valid radius packets. 

You should also see the Gateway version + EUI and other information on starting the concentrator, without any errors.. If you see errors, check troubleshooting below. I have examples of journalctl log at:
https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=13682&highlight=pinedio

[ will edit more soon please check back and feel free to add/fix anything that you notice to help us get Pine64 Gateway running properly! :) ]

***TROUBLESHOOTING:

The Things Network Gateway Commands (SSH/Shell access):
Check the status of ttn-gateway (if selecting The Things Network Channel) service by issuing:
systemctl status ttn-gateway
Restart TTN Gateway:
systemctl restart ttn-gateway
Stop TTN Gateway:
systemctl stop ttn-gateway
Start TTN Gateway:
systemctl start ttn-gateway

Check gateway version/ID
gateway-version

Configuration:
sudo gateway-config

***Gateway failed to start concentrator? 
- Check packet forwarder config to ensure device location is correct: sudo gateway-config ---> edit packet-forwarder config 
* Ensure the SX120x_conf location in packet-forwarder config matches:

        "com_type": "SPI",
        "com_path": "/dev/spidev0.0",
	
* Ensure GPS matches /dev/ttyS2:
	
        "gps_tty_path": "/dev/ttyS2",

(anytime you edit packet-forwarder config, make sure to then restart packet forwarder)

***GPS not registering location? 
- Consider running GPS antenna closer to a window (if indoors). GPS needs a direct line of sight. To test out GPS try looking at gpsmon or cat /dev/ttyS2
(ensuring GPS functions before expecting gateway to read it is recommended)

- See if you have GPS location information by running: cat /dev/ttyS2 or gpsmon (thanks JF for mentioning this- helped me)

If you have more tips/troubleshooting/information, please do send: either as an issue, fork, mod. Or optionally email: righttoprivacy[at]tutanota.com

Thanks! :)
